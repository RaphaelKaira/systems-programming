/**
 * syntax: opendir(const char *name);
   * name: The name of the directory to open. It can be a relative or absolute path.
 * Return values: 
   * DIR: A pointer to a DIR structure representing the opened directory. This pointer is used in subsequent calls to readdir() and closedir().
   * NULL: If the directory cannot be opened (e.g., if it doesnâ€™t exist or permission is denied), opendir() returns NULL. 
 
 * Syntax: readdir(DIR *dirp);
   * dirp: A pointer to a DIR structure obtained from opendir().
 * Return values: 
   * struct dirent: A pointer to a struct dirent representing the next directory entry. This contains information about the file or directory name.
   * NULL: If there are no more entries or if an error occurs.
 * Each call to readdir() returns information about a single directory entry.
 * The function returns a pointer to a struct dirent that holds information about the current entry.
